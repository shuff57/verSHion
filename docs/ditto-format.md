# verSHion Ditto package — `.ditto.json` (format 0.1.0)

A `.ditto.json` file is one UTF-8 JSON document holding **one question bank** and, when the
source was a test, **one exam** laid out as printed. It is the interchange format verSHion's
AI conversion produces and the app imports and exports. It is modeled on Test Parrot's
`.parrot.json` package, but flatter, and it carries what verSHion needs to crop figures out
of the source page.

```json
{
  "format": "queshion/ditto",
  "formatVersion": "0.1.0",
  "generator": { "name": "verSHion", "version": "gemma4:31b" },
  "bank": { "name": "Ch4 Quiz 5A", "questions": [ /* Question, ... */ ] },
  "exams": [ /* zero or one Exam */ ],
  "report": { "unconverted": [], "notes": [] }
}
```

`format` and `formatVersion` are required. Unknown extra members are ignored. `exams` and
`report` may be omitted.

## Question

Common members:

| member | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | unique in the file, e.g. `"q1"`; verSHion assigns its own ids on import |
| `type` | string | `multiple-choice`, `true-false`, `matching`, `fill-in-the-blank`, `short-answer`, `multipart` |
| `stem` | string | exactly what the source prints at the question's number, minus the number and any `[2]` mark. Written in verSHion stem markup (`docs/stem-format.md`): each printed line is a `\n` line, bullets are `• item` lines, numbered lists `1. item` lines, tables pipe rows (see below). Equations are written `$linear$` (e.g. `$x^2+1$`). Subscripts and superscripts in plain text use Unicode (H₂O, m²) |
| `label` | string, optional | the number the source prints ("3", "5B-2"). Informational only |
| `points` | positive integer, optional | only when the source prints a mark. Not on `multipart` itself |
| `difficulty` | `"easy"`/`"medium"`/`"hard"`, optional | only if the source states it |
| `topics` | string[], optional | only if the source states them |
| `explanation` | string, optional | only if the source prints one |
| `figure` | Figure, optional | one picture that belongs to the stem (see below) |

Per type:

- **multiple-choice** — `choices`: `[{ "text": "Ge", "correct": false }, ...]`, in printed order
  (at least two). Several `correct: true` = multiple answer. Mark `correct` only where the source
  gives the answer (answer key, circled or starred choice).
- **true-false** — `answer`: `true`/`false`; omit when the source gives no answer.
- **matching** — `pairs`: `[{ "left": "Na", "right": "sodium" }, ...]`; `distractors`: extra right-hand
  items that match nothing (optional). If the source gives no key, pair items in printed order
  and say so in `report.notes`.
- **fill-in-the-blank** — the stem holds `___` (three underscores) where each blank goes, and
  `blanks` holds one entry per `___`, in order: an array of accepted answers, e.g.
  `[["Ionic"], ["magnesium nitrite", "magnesium(II) nitrite"]]`. A blank with no key is `[]`.
  Every question that asks for several short answers laid out in a table is ONE fill-in-the-blank
  whose stem holds the table as pipe rows: the header row as printed WITHOUT blanks, then each
  body row with a bare `___` in each answer cell, e.g.
  `Formula | Ionic or Covalent? | Name` / `KI | ___ | ___` / `SO₃ | ___ | ___`.
  `blanks` then reads row by row, cell by cell.
- **short-answer** — `suggestedAnswer`: string (the source's worked or sample answer, or `""`).
- **multipart** — one number with lettered parts, or questions sharing one passage/figure.
  The shared material is the `stem` (and `figure`). `parts`: `[{ "stem": "a. NH₃", "type":
  "short-answer"|"multiple-choice"|"true-false", "suggestedAnswer"|"choices"|"answer": ... }]`.
  Part stems keep their own text but drop the `a.`/`(i)` label only when that label is part of
  the numbering rather than the wording.

### Figure

```json
"figure": { "box": [210, 180, 430, 830], "alt": "Lewis structure of CH₃COCl", "page": 1 }
```

- `box` = `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]` on a **0–1000 grid** laid over the page image: y counts
  down from the top edge, x right from the left edge, `ymin < ymax`, `xmin < xmax`. This is the
  order vision models are trained to give boxes in, which is why the conversion prompt asks for
  it. Draw it tightly around the picture, including its labels and captions if they are part of
  the picture, and excluding the question text and answer lines.
  Older files wrote `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` as **fractions** (0–1) instead and still import: a box
  with any value above 1 is read as the grid, a box whose values are all 1 or below as fractions.
- `page` = 1-based page of the source. Optional when converting one page at a time (verSHion
  fills it in).
- `alt` = a short description for accessibility. Never copy handwriting into it.
- Only pictures the question needs: a diagram, graph, map, photo, or structure drawing.
  Equations, tables, typed text and answer lines are NOT figures; write them as text/`$math$`.
- verSHion crops the picture from its own raster of the page and attaches it to the question.
  A figure whose box cannot be cropped (off-page, degenerate) is dropped with a warning; the
  question is still imported.

## Exam (when the source is a test)

```json
{ "name": "Quiz 5A – Ch. 4",
  "sections": [ { "title": "", "instructions": "For multiple choice questions: Circle the letter." } ],
  "positions": [ { "question": "q1", "section": 0 }, { "question": "q2", "section": 0 } ] }
```

One position per converted question, in printed order, `question` = that question's `id`,
`section` = index into `sections`. No exam when the source is a question pool.

## Report

```json
"report": {
  "unconverted": [ { "page": 2, "label": "4", "reason": "answer drawn by hand, no printed question" } ],
  "notes": [ "No answer key printed; no choices marked correct." ]
}
```

## Import behavior (what verSHion guarantees)

- **Tolerant.** Each question is validated alone. One bad question is skipped and reported; it
  never rejects the rest of the page or file.
- **Table repair.** A model often repeats the column heading in every row
  (`KI | Ionic or Covalent? ___ | Name ___`) or puts blanks in the header row
  (`Formula | Ionic or Covalent? ___ | Name ___`). On import such a table is rewritten to the
  clean shape (header without blanks — synthesised with an empty first cell when the rows had
  none — and bare `___` cells); the header's stray blanks are dropped from the marker count, and
  `blanks` is realigned: answers grouped per row are flattened, trailing empty entries are
  padding, and entries for the dropped header blanks are removed. Applies to every stem,
  including multipart part stems.
- Stems never contain the question number, a `[n]` mark, or directions printed above a group.
- Multi-page sources are converted one page per request and merged in page order.
- File extension `.ditto.json`; MIME `application/json`.
