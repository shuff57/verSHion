//! The Account screen's logic: which page shows, the forms, one background job at a time, and
//! status polling. No egui, so tests drive every flow with a mock transport.
//!
//! Network rule: nothing here runs unless [`AccountModel::frame`] is called with the screen open,
//! or the person submits a form on it. Opening the screen builds the [`Client`] (reading the
//! keychain) on first use; closing it stops polling at once. A job already in flight finishes in
//! the background and its result is applied the next time the screen is open.
