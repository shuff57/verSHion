const FREE_BODY_DIAGRAM: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "What belongs on a free body diagram?",
        a: "Just the object and the forces other things exert on it, each drawn as an arrow in the direction it acts. Leave out surfaces, ropes and forces the object exerts on something else. Velocity and acceleration are not forces, so keep them separate from the force arrows.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Should I draw the object as a dot or as a box?",
        a: "Both are common. AP-style answers use a single dot with every arrow starting there, while a block or cart can help younger students picture the situation. Either way, the arrows begin at the center.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are force directions measured?",
        a: "As an angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x direction: 0° is right, 90° is up, 180° is left and 270° is down. Any angle in between tilts the arrow accordingly.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Do the arrow lengths have to be exact?",
        a: "No. Arrow lengths only need to compare the forces: equal forces get equal arrows and a larger force gets a longer one. They show relative size, not a precise scale.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "On a slope, what directions do the normal force and friction take?",
        a: "The normal force is perpendicular to the surface, pushing out of it. Friction runs along the surface, opposite to the motion or the motion that would happen. On a slope of angle θ, the normal force leans θ away from vertical.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How can I ask about components without giving them away?",
        a: "Draw the force by itself and let students resolve it, or show the horizontal and vertical component arrows with their labels left blank. A force F at angle θ has components F cos θ and F sin θ.",
    },
];

const VECTOR_DIAGRAM: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "What does adding vectors tip to tail mean?",
        a: "Place each new vector so it starts where the previous one ends. The resultant is the arrow from the very first tail to the very last tip. For example, 4 units right followed by 3 units up gives a resultant of 5 units at about 36.9° above horizontal.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are a vector's x and y components found?",
        a: "For a vector of size A at angle θ above the horizontal, the x-component is A cos θ and the y-component is A sin θ. The two components and the vector form a right triangle.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do I show subtracting one vector from another?",
        a: "Subtracting B is the same as adding −B, which has the same length as B but points the opposite way (turned 180°). Draw A, then −B from its tip, and the resultant is A − B.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Can students be asked to draw the resultant themselves?",
        a: "Yes. Leave the resultant arrow off the figure so students construct it, and keep its magnitude and direction for your answer key. You can also hide one vector in the chain to make a find-the-missing-vector question.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What is one grid square worth?",
        a: "You choose the scale, because the grid itself carries no numbers. A square might stand for 2 m, 5 m/s or 10 N; state it in the question.",
    },
];

const INCLINED_PLANE: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Why doesn't the normal force point straight up on a ramp?",
        a: "The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface. On a slope tilted θ, it leans θ from vertical, and if nothing else pushes into the ramp its size is mg cos θ.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Which direction does friction act on a ramp?",
        a: "Parallel to the surface, against the motion or the motion that would happen without it. If the block moves down or sits still on the slope, friction acts up the slope; if it is pushed upward, friction acts down the slope.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How is gravity split into parts on a slope?",
        a: "Gravity points straight down with size mg. Along the slope its part is mg sin θ (pulling down the ramp), and into the slope it is mg cos θ. The angle between gravity and the perpendicular to the ramp equals the ramp angle θ.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Does a heavier object have to be drawn bigger?",
        a: "No. The drawing size of an object is independent of its mass, so a 5 kg block can look the same as a 2 kg one. The mass belongs in the label or the question text.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are forces labeled when there are several objects on the ramp?",
        a: "Number each object's forces so they can be told apart, such as F_g1 and F_g2. Objects tied by strings each get tension forces (T₁, T₂), and objects pressed together get a pair of equal and opposite contact forces.",
    },
];

const PULLEY: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "What is an Atwood machine?",
        a: "Two hanging masses joined by one string over a fixed pulley. If the string is light and the pulley frictionless, the heavier mass accelerates down and the lighter one up, with a = (m₂ − m₁)g / (m₁ + m₂).",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "When do tension arrows share one label, and when do they get numbers?",
        a: "One light string over an ideal pulley has the same tension everywhere, so all its arrows can be labeled T. Separate strings can have different tensions, so they are labeled T₁, T₂ and so on.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How does a block and tackle reduce the effort needed?",
        a: "The load is supported by several strands of the same rope, each carrying the same tension. With n supporting strands, the ideal effort is the load's weight divided by n, but the rope must be pulled n times as far.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Which way does friction act on a block on the table?",
        a: "Opposite to the way the block moves or would move. If a hanging mass drags the block toward the pulley, friction on the block points away from the pulley.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do I show only the forces on one of the masses?",
        a: "Use a free body diagram for that single object, drawing only the forces acting on it, such as the tension pulling up and its weight pulling down on a hanging mass.",
    },
];

const PROJECTILE_MOTION: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Why does a projectile follow a parabola?",
        a: "Ignoring air resistance, the horizontal speed never changes while gravity steadily increases the downward speed. Horizontal distance grows in proportion to time and vertical drop in proportion to time squared, which traces a parabola.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What do the positions at equal time intervals show?",
        a: "Horizontally they are evenly spaced, because horizontal velocity is constant. Vertically the gaps grow or shrink, since gravity alters the vertical velocity every moment.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Which launch angle travels farthest?",
        a: "With no air resistance and a launch and landing at the same height, 45°. Two angles the same distance from 45°, for instance 30° and 60°, reach equal range, though the steeper one climbs higher and spends more time in the air.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Are the velocity arrows drawn to scale?",
        a: "Treat them as approximate: they show direction and rough size. Velocity arrows are not forces, so they are commonly drawn dashed to keep the two apart.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What changes when the ball is launched from a cliff?",
        a: "It falls for longer before landing, so it travels farther horizontally than the same launch on level ground. The horizontal velocity still stays constant the whole time.",
    },
];

const MOTION_GRAPHS: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "How do position, velocity and acceleration graphs relate?",
        a: "The slope of the position–time graph is velocity, and the slope of the velocity–time graph is acceleration. Working backward, the change in position equals the area between the velocity–time line and the time axis.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What do different shapes on a position–time graph mean?",
        a: "A flat line means at rest, and a straight sloped line means constant velocity, steeper meaning faster. A curve that gets steeper means speeding up, and one that flattens out means slowing down.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why can a velocity–time graph show a sudden jump?",
        a: "When motion switches straight from one constant velocity to another, the idealized model treats the change as instant. Real objects take a short time to change speed, but textbook straight-line graphs ignore that.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does a tangent line on a position–time graph tell you?",
        a: "Its slope gives the instantaneous velocity at that moment. Students find it by taking rise over run along the tangent.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How can I make graphs that focus on shape only?",
        a: "Hide the axis numbers and gridlines so students describe the motion from the shape alone, then keep the actual values for your answer key.",
    },
];

const SPRING_SCALE: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "How should a spring scale be read?",
        a: "Keep it vertical and look at the pointer. Find what one small division is worth, count to the mark just below the pointer, and add an estimated digit. A scale with 0.2 N divisions, for instance, is recorded to the nearest 0.02 N.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why do some spring scales also have gram markings?",
        a: "A spring scale measures force in newtons, but a gram scale lets it double as a rough balance. With g taken as 10 N/kg, 1 N lines up with 100 g. Only the newton reading is actually a force.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What is a zero error and how do you correct for it?",
        a: "It is a reading other than zero with nothing attached. Subtract that unloaded reading from every loaded one: a scale resting at 0.20 N that reads 4.30 N under load is really measuring 4.10 N.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How does the reading relate to the mass hanging on it?",
        a: "An object hanging still pulls on the hook with a force equal to its weight, mg. So 400 g shows about 3.9 N when g is 9.8 N/kg, or 4 N when g is 10 N/kg.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why are spring scales different colors?",
        a: "School spring scales are often color-coded by their maximum load so the right one can be grabbed quickly. The color is only a convenience; the scale markings are what matter.",
    },
];

const WAVES: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "How are wavelength and amplitude measured?",
        a: "Wavelength is the distance for one full cycle, such as crest to next crest. Amplitude is measured from the rest line (the middle) to a crest, so the crest-to-trough height is twice the amplitude.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do period and frequency show up on a graph?",
        a: "When displacement is plotted against time, one full cycle along the time axis is the period T. Frequency is 1/T, so a period of 0.5 s means 2 Hz.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How does a longitudinal wave match up with a transverse wave picture?",
        a: "Compressions, where particles bunch together, line up with the crests, and rarefactions, where they spread out, line up with the troughs. One compression plus one rarefaction make one wavelength.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What is the difference between a transverse and a longitudinal wave?",
        a: "In a transverse wave the medium moves perpendicular to the direction the wave travels, like a wave on a rope. In a longitudinal wave it moves back and forth along that direction, like sound in air.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are wave speed, frequency and wavelength connected?",
        a: "Wave speed equals frequency times wavelength (v = fλ). A wave with a 2 m wavelength at 3 Hz travels at 6 m/s.",
    },
];

const CIRCUIT_DIAGRAM: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Can the figure work out the current and voltages, and make a worksheet from it?",
        a: "Yes. Type numbers for the battery and each part (12 V, 4 Ω, 4.7 kΩ) and set Work out the circuit to Fill meter readings or Readings and results. It handles series, parallel and an open switch; a part typed as a symbol such as R cannot be worked out, so that reading keeps your text. Turn off Show answers for a student copy: the worked-out values become blank lines, and Student + key saves both.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How can I turn a circuit into a problem for students?",
        a: "Give some values, like the battery voltage and resistances, and leave others unknown: a blank ammeter reading, a resistor labeled x, or a voltmeter whose reading students must find.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why do resistor symbols look different in different books?",
        a: "US texts usually draw a resistor as a zigzag, while IEC symbols used in the UK and Europe draw it as a plain rectangle. Lamps differ too, but cells, switches and meters look much the same in both styles.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What is the difference between a cell and a battery symbol?",
        a: "A single cell is drawn as two parallel plates of different lengths, and the longer one marks the + terminal. Join two or more cells end to end and you have a battery.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are ammeters and voltmeters connected?",
        a: "An ammeter goes in series, in the path of the current it measures. A voltmeter goes in parallel, with its leads on either side of the component it measures.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do series and parallel circuits behave differently?",
        a: "In series, the same current flows through every part and the voltages add up to the battery voltage. In parallel, each branch gets the full battery voltage and the branch currents add up to the total.",

const POPULATION_GROWTH: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "How does exponential growth differ from logistic growth?",
        a: "With unlimited resources, a population grows exponentially, dN/dt = rN, curving upward ever more steeply (a J shape). In the logistic model, dN/dt = rN(K − N)/K, growth brakes as numbers approach the carrying capacity K, so the curve flattens into an S shape that levels at K.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "At what population size does logistic growth happen fastest?",
        a: "When the population is half of K (N = K/2). That point, the S curve's inflection point, has the fastest growth; below it growth accelerates and above it growth slows.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does per capita growth rate mean?",
        a: "It is dN/dt shared out per individual, that is dN/dt ÷ N. Exponential growth keeps it fixed at r, while logistic growth makes it drop linearly from r to zero as N reaches K.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How is the doubling time of an exponentially growing population found?",
        a: "Doubling time is ln 2 ÷ r, roughly 0.693 ÷ r. At r = 0.5 per year, numbers double about every 1.39 years.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What do the lag, exponential and stationary phases describe?",
        a: "They describe a culture's growth curve: a slow start while numbers are small (lag), a period of rapid growth (exponential), then a plateau close to the carrying capacity (stationary).",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why might a population overshoot its carrying capacity?",
        a: "If the population responds to crowding with a delay, it can keep growing past K before births and deaths catch up, then swing back. Small delays settle down; longer ones can cause lasting oscillations.",
    },
];

const PREDATOR_PREY: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Why do predator numbers peak after prey numbers?",
        a: "Predators need time to turn abundant food into more offspring, so their numbers keep climbing after the prey peak. Once there are many predators, prey decline, food runs short, predators fall and prey recover. The gap between the two peaks is the lag.",
    },

        q: "What is the Lotka–Volterra model?",
        a: "Two coupled equations: dx/dt = αx − βxy for prey x and dy/dt = δxy − γy for predators y. Prey multiply on their own and are lost when they meet predators; predators gain from eating prey and die off otherwise, so the two populations cycle.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What is the classic real-world example of these cycles?",
        a: "Snowshoe hares and Canada lynx, whose numbers rose and fell roughly every ten years with the lynx trailing the hares. Real cycles also depend on food supply and other predators, so the model is a simplification.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does a phase plane graph of predators versus prey show?",
        a: "Instead of plotting each population against time, it plots one against the other. Because the cycle repeats, the points form a closed loop, and one trip around is one full cycle.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do students find the period and lag from the graph?",
        a: "The period is the time between two successive peaks of the same population. The lag is the time from a prey peak to the predator peak that follows it.",

        a: "Write the possible gametes of one parent across the top and of the other parent down the side, each gamete carrying one allele per gene. Each box gets the alleles from its column plus its row; Tt × Tt gives TT, Tt, Tt and tt.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What ratios come from crossing two heterozygotes (Tt × Tt)?",
        a: "The genotypes split 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt. Since TT and Tt look alike under complete dominance, the phenotypes split 3 dominant : 1 recessive.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Where does the 9:3:3:1 ratio come from?",
        a: "A parent heterozygous for two independently assorting genes, like RrYy, makes four gamete types equally often. A 4 × 4 square gives 16 boxes: 9 show both dominant traits, 3 and 3 show one each, and 1 shows both recessive traits.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How are sex-linked crosses written?",
        a: "Write the alleles as superscripts on the X chromosomes, such as X^B X^b for a carrier mother and X^B Y for a father; the Y carries no allele. Report results separately for daughters and sons, because a son's single X always comes from his mother.",

        q: "How can a pedigree show whether a trait is dominant or recessive?",
        a: "Look for parents who match each other but have a child who differs. Two unaffected parents with an affected child means recessive; two affected parents with an unaffected child means dominant. Recessive traits often skip generations, while dominant ones usually appear in each one.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What pattern suggests an X-linked recessive trait?",
        a: "Mostly males are affected: an affected man hands the allele to his daughters, who carry it, and they may pass it to their sons. Fathers never pass it to sons. An affected daughter of an unaffected father rules it out.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does Y-linked inheritance look like?",
        a: "The trait appears only in males and is handed from every affected father to all of his sons, straight down the male line. Finding an affected female, or an affected boy whose father is unaffected, rules it out.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What do the shapes and shading in a pedigree mean?",
        a: "Squares are males and circles are females. A filled symbol is affected, and a half-filled or dotted one is a carrier. Horizontal lines join partners, children hang below, and generations are numbered with Roman numerals.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why are some genotypes written with a blank, like A_?",
        a: "Sometimes the pedigree only proves one allele. An unaffected person in a recessive family might be AA or Aa, so the second allele is left as a blank.",

const GEL_ELECTROPHORESIS: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Why do short DNA fragments move farther through the gel?",
        a: "DNA carries a negative charge, so it is pulled from the wells toward the positive electrode. The gel acts like a sieve, and shorter pieces squeeze through it faster, so they travel farther in the same time.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How is a DNA ladder used to estimate band sizes?",
        a: "The ladder lane contains fragments whose lengths are known. Line a sample band up against the nearest ladder bands to estimate its size; for more accuracy, graph log of fragment size versus migration distance and read the unknown off that standard curve.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do you decide which suspect matches in a DNA fingerprint?",
        a: "The match is the lane whose bands line up exactly with every band in the evidence lane, with no extras or missing bands. In a paternity test, each of the child's bands must come from either the mother or the father.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How does gel percentage affect what you can separate?",
        a: "Lower-percentage gels have larger pores and separate big fragments well. Higher percentages have smaller pores and resolve small fragments, such as short PCR products.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why are some bands darker or thicker than others?",

    Faq {
        q: "Why are some digits shown in red?",
        a: "On many pipettes, red digits mark the places after the decimal point. Different brands mark the decimal differently, so check the models in your own lab.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do you choose the right micropipette for a volume?",
        a: "Pick the smallest pipette whose range includes the volume, because accuracy drops near the bottom of a range. Each typically works from about a tenth of its maximum up to the maximum, so 15 µL suits a P20 and 150 µL a P200.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does the number in P20 or P200 tell you?",
        a: "It is the top volume the pipette can deliver, in µL. Because the two displays look the same, identical digits stand for different volumes on each, so always check the pipette size first.",

    Faq {
        q: "How precise is a gas syringe reading?",

const HEATING_COOLING_CURVE: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "Why does the temperature stay level during melting or boiling?",
        a: "The energy added goes into separating particles (raising potential energy) rather than speeding them up, so the temperature holds until the phase change finishes. During freezing or condensing the same energy is released.",

        q: "Why is the boiling flat section longer than the melting one?",
        a: "Turning a liquid into a gas separates the particles completely, which needs much more energy than melting, where they only loosen. Water's heat of vaporization is about 6.8 times its heat of fusion.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Which calculations go with each part of the curve?",
        a: "Sloped parts, where temperature changes, use q = m·c·ΔT. Flat parts, where the phase changes, use q = n·ΔH (or m times the latent heat).",

    Faq {
        q: "What does the slope of a sloped section tell you?",

        q: "Why does every element have its own set of lines?",
        a: "Electrons can only occupy certain energy levels. When one drops to a lower level, the atom emits light whose energy, and so wavelength, equals the gap. Each element's levels are different, so its lines act like a fingerprint.",

    Faq {
        q: "How can you tell which elements made an unknown spectrum?",
        a: "Check it against reference spectra. An element counts as present only when every one of its lines shows up in the unknown, since a mixture produces all the lines of each element it contains.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do emission and absorption spectra differ?",
        a: "An emission spectrum is bright colored lines on a dark background, from a hot glowing gas. An absorption spectrum is a continuous rainbow with dark gaps, made when white light passes through a cooler gas. The gaps fall at the same wavelengths as the bright lines.",

    Faq {
        q: "Why are only a few lines shown for each element?",

    Faq {
        q: "How does water displacement give an object's volume?",
        a: "Read the water level before and after adding the object; the difference is the volume of the object. For example, 32.0 mL rising to 38.5 mL means 6.5 mL, which is 6.5 cm³.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Does the object have to be fully under water?",
        a: "Yes. Only the part that is submerged pushes water up, so a floating or partly covered object gives too small a volume.",

    Faq {
        q: "Why use displacement instead of a ruler?",
        a: "Irregular objects like rocks have no simple formula for volume. Displacement works for any shape that sinks and doesn't absorb water.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why use a smaller graduated cylinder when possible?",
        a: "Smaller cylinders have finer markings, so the before and after readings, and their difference, are more precise.",

    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why does a buret's scale run from the top down?",
        a: "A buret records how much liquid has drained out, so its scale begins at 0 near the top and counts up as you go down. With 0.1 mL markings, it is read to 0.01 mL.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Is a beaker as precise as a graduated cylinder?",
        a: "No. Beaker markings are far apart and only approximate, so a beaker is useful for rough volumes. Graduated cylinders and burets are used for measurement.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Is a reading in cm³ different from one in mL?",
        a: "No. One cubic centimeter is exactly one milliliter, so only the unit label changes.",

    Faq {
        q: "What is parallax error?",
        a: "Reading from above or below the liquid level makes the meniscus look higher or lower than it is. Keeping your eye level with it avoids the error.",

        q: "How do you find the perimeter of a composite shape?",

    Faq {
        q: "How do you find a missing side length?",
        a: "Use the sides you know on the same line: opposite sides of a rectangular outline add up to the same total, so a missing piece is the whole length minus the other parts.",

    Faq {
        q: "How do you make a number line for fractions?",

    Faq {
        q: "What is an idler gear?",
        a: "A gear between two others. It reverses nothing overall but changes the direction of the last gear.",

const ORTHOGRAPHIC: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "How do I describe the stack?",
        a: "A grid of numbers, one row per line, the back row first. Each number is how many cubes are stacked there, 0 to 5, up to 5 by 5.",

    Faq {
        q: "Why are some rows shorter than others?",
        a: "Short rows are padded with zeros, so a missing number means no cubes.",

    Faq {
        q: "How do I mark a colour scheme?",
        a: "Choose a scheme and a starting colour. Complementary marks two opposite colours, triadic three evenly spaced, analogous three neighbours, split complementary one and the two beside its opposite.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does Show answers do?",
        a: "On, the colours are named and the scheme is drawn. Off, the wheel is left with blank lines to fill in.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why does the Print style look different?",
        a: "It uses greys, so colours become lightness steps and the names matter more than the shades.",

    Faq {
        q: "Can I move and resize the box?",
        a: "Yes: size, position across, position down from the horizon and depth. Only the faces you could really see are drawn, so a box that straddles the horizon shows no top or bottom.",

    },
    Faq {
        q: "What can I show?",
        a: "The four lobes with the cerebellum and brain stem, or the four lobes only.",

    Faq {
        q: "What goes in the boxes?",
        a: "Your sample, what each group gets (2 to 4 groups, the control group last) and what is measured. Your text fills the boxes; the roles are the answers.",

    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why a control group?",
        a: "It shows what happens without the treatment, so any difference can be put down to the treatment.",

const SAMPLING_DISTRIBUTION: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "What is the standard error?",
        a: "The standard deviation of the sample means: the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why is the sample-means curve narrower?",
        a: "Averages vary less than single values. A bigger sample makes the curve narrower still, by the square root of n.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do I find a probability for a sample mean?",
        a: "Shade a region, then use the standard error instead of the population standard deviation. Turn Show answers on to see the result.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does Show answers do?",
        a: "On, the standard error and the probability are written in. Off, the curves and shading stay and those two are blank lines for students.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Is the curve always a bell?",

    },
    Faq {
        q: "What does the tail choice mean?",
        a: "Two-tailed splits α between both tails, right-tailed puts it all on the right and left-tailed all on the left.",

    Faq {
        q: "What does Show answers do?",

        a: "Reject H0 when the p-value is below α, which is the same as the statistic landing in the shaded region.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why does the axis change?",
        a: "It widens to include the critical values and the statistic, up to a limit. A statistic far outside is not marked but the decision still works.",

    },
    Faq {
        q: "What do the degrees of freedom mean?",
        a: "(rows - 1) times (columns - 1). The p-value is the chance of a chi-square this large or larger.",

    Faq {
        q: "What if an expected count is small?",
        a: "The key warns when the smallest expected count is below 5, since the chi-square approximation is then unreliable.",

const MOTION_MAP: &[Faq] = &[
    Faq {
        q: "What does the spacing of the dots tell me?",
        a: "Each dot is the object's position at one tick of the clock. Dots that are farther apart mean a larger velocity, evenly spaced dots mean constant velocity, and dots that bunch together mean it is slowing down.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do I make an object speed up, cruise and slow down?",
        a: "Set how long it speeds up, how long it keeps a constant velocity and how long it slows down. The acceleration sets how quickly the velocity changes in the first and last stages.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Why is there no arrow on some dots?",
        a: "A dot gets a velocity arrow only while the object is moving. A dot at rest has no arrow, because its velocity is zero.",

        a: "One ray travels parallel to the axis and bends through the focal point, one passes through the centre of a lens (or strikes the middle of a mirror) and one goes through the focal point and comes out parallel. Where they meet is the image.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "When is the image real and when is it virtual?",
        a: "A real image forms where rays truly cross, so it can be caught on a screen, and it is upside down. When the object is inside the focal length the rays only appear to meet, giving an upright virtual image.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "How do I change the object distance and focal length?",
        a: "Use the sliders for the focal length and the object distance, both in centimetres. The image distance and size update to match the lens or mirror equation.",
    },
    Faq {
        q: "Can I hide the labels for a student copy?",
        a: "Yes. Turn off Label the points to remove them, or blank a label so students write it in. You can also hide the image and draw only one or two rays.",
