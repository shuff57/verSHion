//! The import contract: how a client turns a received keyless (stripped) question into its own
//! local model, and how the teacher's re-entered key turns it back into a full question.
//!
//! # The served stripped Matching form
//! `pairs[i].left` in the author's order; every `pairs[i].right` is `""`; `distractors` holds the
//! **word bank**: all right-hand items (the answers and the true distractors together),
//! de-duplicated by exact text, in one random order fixed at publish time. `keyless` is `true`.
//! The word bank is not split into "answers" and "distractors" because that split *is* the key.
//!
//! Why no separate `bank` field (and no schema v3): the app's model has no such field, so an older
//! build would drop it and lose the word bank entirely; and the served form is only ever read by
//! the importer below, which must convert it anyway. `keyless: true` plus all-empty rights is
//! unambiguous, and `validate` refuses an empty right side on a question that is not keyless.
//!
//! # Conversion on import ([`localize`])
//! For every question with `keyless: true`:
//! 1. `explanation` becomes [`KEYLESS_SENTINEL`] (older builds drop `keyless` on re-save but keep
//!    and print the explanation, so the answer key always says it has no key).
//! 2. Nothing else changes. In particular the copy carries **no placeholder key**: Matching keeps
//!    its empty right sides with the word bank in `distractors`, Mc keeps every `correct` false,
//!    Blank keeps empty accept lists. The app prints the right column with [`right_column`]
//!    (`model::right_column`, empties skipped), so the student sheet shows exactly the word bank.
//!    A keyless **Tf** still holds `correct: false` because the model has no "unset" value: that
//!    `false` is not a key, and the `keyless` field (with the sentinel for older builds) is what
//!    says so. Every printing and export path must check `keyless` and print no key.
//! 3. The copy must be re-keyed ([`rekey`]) before it is used as a keyed question; until then
//!    `validate_for_publish` refuses it without `hide_key`, and the app prints "Key not provided".
//!
//! # Re-entering the key ([`rekey`], every kind)
//! The teacher picks, for each left item, one item of the right column (`pairs[].right` then
//! `distractors`, empties skipped, as the sheet shows it). The picks become `pairs[].right`; every
//! column item not picked becomes a distractor, once; `keyless` is cleared and the sentinel removed.
//! No item is ever duplicated or lost. Picks are indices into the column the teacher was shown,
//! checked against it (out of range is refused). The other kinds take their key directly
//! ([`Key`]): the correct choice indices (Mc, at least one), true/false (Tf), one non-empty accept
//! list per blank (Blank), the sample (Short), and one part key per part of the same kinds
//! (Multipart). `rekey` is the only way `keyless` is cleared.
//!
//! # Publishing an imported copy
//! `validate_for_publish` refuses a question that is still keyless (or still carries the sentinel)
//! unless the publish has `hide_key`, so the placeholder layout is never served as a real key.
